## Project Overview
The **CSS Cat Face** project is designed to create a cat face illustration using only HTML for structure and CSS for styling. This project is a great example of how simple shapes and CSS properties can be combined to create an intricate visual.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3

## Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the cat face illustration.

## Features
- **Custom Shapes**: The cat face, ears, eyes, nose, and whiskers are all made using CSS properties like `border-radius`, `position`, and `transform`.
- **Responsive Centering**: The cat illustration is centered on the page for easy viewing on various screen sizes.
- **Color Gradients**: The background color and cat head color use CSS gradients to add depth to the design.
